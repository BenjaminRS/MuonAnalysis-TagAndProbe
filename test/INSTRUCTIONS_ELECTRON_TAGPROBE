There are two steps to calculate efficiency using tag-and-probe method. 
In the first step, you need to make EDM TTree using your favorite "tag" 
and "probe" selections. In the second step, you calculate efficiency 
(= number of passing probe / total number of probe) by either fitting for 
the Z--> e+e- invariant mass peak, or by performing a background 
subtraction, or by kooking into the truth match.  

 Here is a brief outline of the two steps. The relevant configuration 
scripts have more detailed comments.



I. Make EDM TTree by modifying the example script 
   "GenericElectronRecoEffEDM_example.cfg":

  1.) Modify the "PoolSource" module to run over your favorite data sample.
  2.) Modify the following line to choose your own tag-probe pair: 
     'include "MuonAnalysis/TagAndProbe/data/tag_probe_electron_example.cfi"'
  3.) Also modify the "outpath" module to change the output file name.




II. Calculate efficiency as function of 'eta', 'p_T', 'phi', 'p', 
    'px', 'py', or 'pz'. You can choose two variables at a time. 
    There is also support for two-dimensional efficiency binning.

   1.) Modify the "PoolSource" module to run over your EDM TTree.
   2.) Set the boolean variables "CalculateEffSideBand", 
       "CalculateEffFitter", and "CalculateEffTruth" to 'true' or 
       'false' depending on which method(s) you want to use. You can set 
       all the three to 'true'.
   3.) If using "CalculateEffFitter" method (i.e., if you are fitting for 
       signal and background events using a likelihood fit), you can set the 
       boolean variable "UnbinnedFit" to 'true' if you want to perform 
       unbinned maximum likelihood fit. Otherwise, MINUIT will do a binned 
       maximum likelihood fit by default.
   4.) Also modify the "FitFileName" to change the output file name. 
       This file stores the histohrams for pass/fail events, the MINUIT fit 
       plots, and "Efficiency vs. eta", "Efficiency vs. p_T", ... etc. plots.
